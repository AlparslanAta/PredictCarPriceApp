# PredictCarPriceApp
 In this project, I predict car prices using Python. I use Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations. Scikit-learn helps with data splitting, encoding categorical features, and creating a Linear Regression model to make accurate price predictions.
